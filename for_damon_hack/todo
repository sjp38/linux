TODOs
=====

- Online parameter updates
  (sysfs, DARC: echo update_sysfs > status)

- Monitoring results in sysfs
  (Apply nr_accesses and age of regions to sysfs region dirs)
  (echo update_kdamond > status)

- DAMON-based Proactive LRU Sorting (DAMON_PLRUS)
  (Make hot LRU pages placed near the head of their LRU lists)
  - PoC with vaddr+DAMOS_COLD

--- aims to do above before the v5.18 release ---

- Multiple contexts per kdamond
  (to avoid interference between different contexts)

- Monitoring time quota
  Let users set time quota and automatically adjust
  {min,max}_nr_regions based on the time usage (per-context).

- Automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)

- Fixed monitoring target range for vaddr monitoring
  New damon_ops (echo fvaddr > ops) or sysfs file (echo N > auto_regions_update)

- DAMOS denylist
  Don't bother knowlegeable user space processes

- DAMON-based Proactive Compaction

- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation

- Autopilot for DAMOS
  - Set watermarks based on min_freebytes
  - Adjust coldness threshold with PSI

- DAMON-based THP hinting

- Improve regions-based monitoring quality

- Support cgroups
